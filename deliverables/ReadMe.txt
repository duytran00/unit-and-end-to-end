IDE: Eclipse with Jacoco/EclEmma

1) complete instructions given by default in GitHub
2) create JUnit test files (unitTest and programTest) and a corrected version file of source code (PrinttokensFixed) in the same folder (src) as Printtokens.java
3) create a temporary folder (temp) in the root of project file (testing-blue42)
4) All JUnit tests will run their tests on the corrected version file (PrintTokenFixed) and changes will be made on it as well.
5) To run JUnit test file to view failures, right click JUnit file and go to "Run As" -> "1 JUnit Test".
6) To run JUnit test file to view coverage: First step) all files that are not the one JUnit file running (only either unitTest or programTest) and the file tested on (PrintTokenFixed) is to be moved into temporary folder (temp). Second step) right click the JUnit file and go to "Coverage As" -> "1 JUnit Test".
